I think
[my opinion](http://www.abevoelker.com/blog/2010/08/21/progress-openedge-abl-language-and-dbms-considered-harmful/)
on Progress OpenEdge ABL (henceforth known as "the Plague") as a programming
language / DBMS is well known, but here is a short summary in case you missed it:

Progress made a bet a long time ago (back in the 1980s) that the future of
programming languages were going to be languages with a huge amount of global
keywords bolted into the syntax, which handle complex processing tasks for the
programmer in a closed/magical way (the programmer would have no idea how it
really happens, by design), including database access.  They called this a
"4GL", or fourth-generation language.

Obviously, Progress lost that bet.  What Progress belittlingly refers to as
the "3GL"s (e.g. C/C++, Java, C#, Perl, ...), which have a much lighter
dictionary of reserved keywords and 'bolted-on' syntax for performing tasks,
have been proven by industry to actually be much better designed due to their
modularity and extensibility.  This extensibility, which allows programmers to
easily create powerful external libraries and frameworks, fulfills what
Progress sought to do 25 years ago but without the added headache of coupling
implementation details to the language specification (I use 'specification'
lightly, since there really is no language specification publicly available for
OpenEdge that would allow one to write a compiler for it).

In my opinion, most modern shops that use Progress OpenEdge ABL probably wish
there was a way to get away from it, since in today's modern world it doesn't
take very long to hit the limits of a language that takes the exact opposite
design approach that the rest of the world takes.  The rest of the world is
busy creating all sorts of dazzling libraries and frameworks that make
programming useful, efficient and exciting while OpenEdge customers are stuck
with whatever closed-source, cheap imitation solution Progress Software Corp.
is able to create and bolt on to the language, in an attempt to re-create the
popular thing from 4+ years ago.  Not to mention the exorbitant licensing
costs for the pleasure of all of the above...

Some people think that OpenEdge ABL is still worth saving, but not me.  The
only remedy to this problem, in my opinion, is to migrate completely away from
the OpenEdge platform.  Read on for the migration plan (henceforth known as
"the Cure").

## Migration Language Requirements

Having decided to migrate, the next step should be to define what capabilities
and features to look for in a target migration language.  What do you think is
important to have?  Here is what I came up with:

1. Language must support object orientation (and primarily be oriented that
   way)
  * No explanation needed; object-oriented (OO) programming is a necessity.
2. Data access should be able to be object-oriented as well (objects should be
   persistable)
  * If one is primarily programming in OO, it makes since to fetch and persist
    objects in the same manner.  This might be handled by using an
    object-oriented database directly, or by an object-relational mapping
    framework (which maps objects to a relational database).  More on the
    latter point in the next section.
3. Should be CRUD-friendly
  * OpenEdge is primarily data-focused.  However, data access is atrocious -
    gathering data into cohesive units to make useful decisions upon takes a
    lot of fine-grained table querying and joining on the developer's part due
    to OpenEdge's limitations.  OpenEdge developers waste a lot of time coding
    these CRUD operations over and over entirely by hand, creating repeated
    code blocks all over the place (which is a more error-prone process and
    creates code that is resistant to change and expensive to update), using
    fine-grained scalar details of the tables involved.  An optimal target
    language should make CRUD a much simplified process, but still have the
    ability to drop down in to fine-grained details where necessary.
4. Language must be able to swap data stores in a modular fashion (no tight
   coupling between database and language)
  * Getting locked in to a specific database is a form of tight coupling (look
    at what happened when Oracle bought out MySQL).
5. Should have good support for Web application development
  * Due to the aforementioned focus on data-access/CRUD that OpenEdge has, it
    is no surprise that many companies (mine included) that use OpenEdge have
    begun moving many programs to WebSpeed (i.e. server-side OpenEdge ABL).  It
    is an efficient way to provide a lightweight and well-presented interface
    to the data for customers.
6. Should not be coupled to a specific operating system
  * Like requirement #4, this is another form of coupling.  In today's day and
    age it shouldn't be tolerated.

This is the basic list of capabilities that I think are important.  If you have
anything to add or disagree with, please post in the comments section.

## Object-Relational Mapping

I would like to take a minute to expound on a specific topic before continuing
any further:
[object-relational mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
(ORM).

Before I even started to concretely define exactly what I needed in a migration
language, I already knew that the two most important things were that the
language as well as the database access be object-oriented.  During my
senior year at university, I was able to use
[NHibernate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHibernate) a little bit
for one of my final class projects.  It introduced me to the ability to nearly
transparently fetch and persist objects from a relational database (in this
case MySQL).  In other words, object-relational mapping.  The beauty of having
a framework create complex database queries - filtering, sorting, joining
tables, etc. - just by using some simple macro keywords on object properties
and methods, and returning a collection of objects, is truly a thing of beauty.
In addition, by using a relational database at the core, one is able to quickly
write simple, scalar-based queries for retrieving data when you really don't
need to pull out entire objects.  In other words, you can have both the speed
of fine-grained scalar queries and the power and flexibility of object-based
queries.

However, I have noticed some dangerous topics crop up on
[PSDN](http://communities.progress.com/pcom/index.jspa) and other
OpenEdge discussion areas that make it seem that an object-relational mapping
framework for OpenEdge ABL is something to aspire to, and furthermore will be
some sort of magic bullet for carrying on using OpenEdge into the future.  Let
me put it bluntly: ORM is a very complex thing.  One feature here and another
feature there (e.g. a Collections interface like Java has) added to OpenEdge
ABL will not make it able to do ORM cleanly.  There are some [serious
issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch)
that have to be worked out; these issues require a language that is very strong
in its object-oriented capabilities in order to overcome them.  OpenEdge is
not, and probably will never be strong enough in OO to be able to handle
something like this as cleanly as many other languages have already made it.  I
will write another post entirely on this subject in more detail to explain why
some popular opinions on OpenEdge ABL getting ORM are either not well-founded
or simply Bad Ideas.

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's continue on with how to break out
of the OpenEdge system.

## Jailbreaking

Having created a wishlist of features to have, we now have to face reality.  We
cannot simply click our heels together three times and be completely on a new
language and data store.  There will undoubtedly be a transitional period
between OpenEdge ABL and the target, during which they will have to work
together.  I foresee two different ways to accomplish this:

1. Identify OpenEdge subsystems that can be replaced.  Completely rewrite these
subsystems in the new language, and migrate the OpenEdge data over to the new
data store.  Then, flip a switch to start running the subsystems entirely in
the new language.  The replaced OpenEdge subsystem can then be removed.  If
there still exists OpenEdge subsystems that need to interact with this new one,
then an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) such as a JMS (e.g. Apache ActiveMQ) can
be used to send messages between them across the differing datastores.
2. If the new language can connect to the OpenEdge database, then write
programs in the new language in small pieces that can run alongside existing
Progress OpenEdge ABL programs within the same subsystem (they will both fetch
and persist from/to the same OpenEdge database(s)).  Once the entire subsystem
has been sufficiently converted, then the OpenEdge database data can be
migrated to a data store that the new language can use more efficiently (and
the legacy OpenEdge data can be destroyed).  At this point, #1 can take effect
- the switch gets flipped, etc.

Clearly option #2 would be the more useful option, since the conversion can be
done in smaller steps, allowing for better integration testing along the entire
process.  If you are wondering how #2 is even possible, let me draw you a
picture:

[singlepic id=1 w=500 h=375 float=center]

In case you didn't know, OpenEdge allows one to run a SQL-92 engine
concurrently with the OpenEdge engine (see [SQL
Development](http://documentation.progress.com/output/OpenEdge102b/pdfs/dmsdv/dmsdv.pdf)
and [SQL
Reference](http://documentation.progress.com/output/OpenEdge102b/pdfs/dmsrf/dmsrf.pdf)
OpenEdge documentation for more info)!  This small but amazing fact means that
you can run non-OpenEdge programs against the OpenEdge database using
[ODBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODBC) or
[JDBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC) drivers; these programs will simply
see SQL datatypes and not know the true, horrible secret of what lies beneath.

I am going to concentrate on migration options that satisfy method #2 above,
since I believe that it is the most flexible.  In addition, I have found from
reading the aforementioned SQL manuals that it seems that the JDBC driver is
the more supported/robust method of connecting to the OpenEdge databases using
SQL. I have come to this conclusion by seeing the deprecated ODBC examples in
the handbooks as well as anecdotal evidence from perusing online discussions
that the ODBC driver is not as fast as the JDBC one (please correct me in the
comments section if I am incorrect in this assumption!).

## Potpourri

Now that we have both a list of goals and a list of limitations, it is finally
time to start researching viable migration target languages.  I have
restricted myself to languages capable of running the JDBC drivers, however, so
my choices are limited to [languages that run on top of a Java Virtual
Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages) (JVM). Keeping
this restriction in mind, these are my top three choices, in no particular
order:

* Java
* Groovy
* Ruby (JRuby interpreter)

Here is how each of the choices match up against the list of requirements/desired features I had written:

### Java
1. Language must support object orientation (and primarily be oriented that
   way)
  * Check.
2. Data access should be able to be object-oriented as well (objects should be
   persistable)
  * [Java Persistence API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API)
    (JPA) 2.0 seems to be the new direction for ORM on Java; it appears to be
    quite powerful.  [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/) used to be the
    popular choice, but is now an extension of JPA2.
3. Should be CRUD-friendly
  * I don't think JPA2 itself is very CRUD-friendly; I don't know of any
    extensions that make it that way either (please correct me if I am wrong on
    this).
4. Language must be able to swap data stores in a modular fashion (no tight
   coupling between database and language)
  * Check - JDBC.
5. Should have good support for Web application development
  * Check - [Apache Struts](http://struts.apache.org/); many, many others.
6. Should not be coupled to a specific operating system
  * Check - JVM.

### Groovy

1. Language must support object orientation (and primarily be oriented that
   way)
  * Check.
2. Data access should be able to be object-oriented as well (objects should be
   persistable)
  * [GORM](http://www.grails.org/GORM)
3. Should be CRUD-friendly
  * [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) nails this.
4. Language must be able to swap data stores in a modular fashion (no tight
   coupling between database and language)
  * JDBC is primarily used.
5. Should have good support for Web application development
  * [Grails](http://www.grails.org/).
6. Should not be coupled to a specific operating system
  * Check - JVM.

### JRuby

1. Language must support object orientation (and primarily be oriented that
   way)
  * Check.
2. Data access should be able to be object-oriented as well (objects should be
   persistable)
  * Very strong - there are several popular ORM frameworks, including
    [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.org/) and
    [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/).
3. Should be CRUD-friendly
  * [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) nails this.
4. Language must be able to swap data stores in a modular fashion (no tight
   coupling between database and language)
  * Check.  Can use old methods like straight JDBC or try new things like
    [DataObjects](https://github.com/datamapper/do)
5. Should have good support for Web application development
  * [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
6. Should not be coupled to a specific operating system
  * Check - JVM.

## The Winner

For my own requirements, I see JRuby as the best choice.  The main two
features that convinced me are the strong ORM support and the power of Ruby on
Rails for performing Web development and CRUD operations.  It also seems like a
language that legacy developers that are new to OO wouldn't have too much
trouble picking up - it doesn't require a lot of the heavyweight OO design
knowledge that a language like Java requires.  Also, because JRuby runs on the
JVM, one can run Java code in-line with Ruby code, if so desired (of course,
Groovy has this same feature, and Java can run Groovy or JRuby JVM bytecode as
well, so it isn't really unique to JRuby).

## Which ORM?

Ruby has several choices in regards to ORM.  However, there are two choices
that are the most popular: [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.org)
and [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/).  These two choices are
rooted in two different design patterns originally defined by Martin Fowler in
his book,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420?ie=UTF8&tag=perwebofabevo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perwebofabevo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321127420" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

### ActiveRecord

[ActiveRecord](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html)
is defined by Fowler as: "***An object that wraps a row in a database table or
view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data***."

<a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html"><img src='http://www.abevoelker.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/migration_illustrations/activerecordsketch.gif' alt='Active Record (Design Pattern)' class='ngg-singlepic ngg-center' /></a>

ActiveRecord is a relatively simple concept of ORM.  The idea is that a class
maps directly to a database table, and the class is responsible for
implementing all of the database operations related to itself (insert, update,
etc.).

In relation to Ruby, the [ActiveRecord framework](http://ar.rubyonrails.org)
is the well-known face of Ruby ORM.  It has been around for a long time, and
was coupled directly to Ruby on Rails until only very recently.

In regards to OpenEdge, there would have to be an adapter written to wrap the
JDBC driver in order to conform to the ActiveRecord framework API.  Amazingly,
some Parisians have [already
written](https://github.com/kantena/activerecord-openedge-adapter)
such an adapter and released the source on GitHub under the open-source MIT
license!  Major kudos to them.

### DataMapper

[DataMapper](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html) is defined by
Fowler as: "***A layer of Mappers (473) that moves data between objects and a
database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper
itself.***"

<a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html"><img src='http://www.abevoelker.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/migration_illustrations/databasemappersketch.gif' alt='Data Mapper (Design Pattern)' class='ngg-singlepic ngg-center' /></a>

DataMapper is a more complex form of ORM than ActiveRecord.  From the Fowler
illustration, it is clear that the separation of objects and their mappings
creates a very powerful design mechanism, which does not limit developers to a
1:1 mapping between classes and database tables.  One can see that this makes
it more useful for supporting legacy database schemas, where one already has a
pre-defined database schema and is trying to map it into objects (which is
backwards when compared to most modern ORM use-cases, where developers are
creating database schemas to fit their already-defined classes).

In relation to Ruby, the [DataMapper framework](http://datamapper.org/)
is a relatively new framework, but is gaining a lot of traction and seems to
hold a lot of promise.  The new version of Rails (v3) is no longer tied in with
the ActiveRecord framework - it is now ORM-agnostic.  This means that DataMapper
integration can be achieved much easier and more cleanly than it used to be.

In regards to OpenEdge, like ActiveRecord, there would have to be an adapter
written in Ruby to wrap the JDBC driver to make it implement the DataMapper
framework API (called a [DataObject](http://github.com/datamapper/do)).
There is currently no such adapter openly available.

### My Choice

I believe that DataMapper is the best migratory choice for large OpenEdge
installations.  ActiveRecord is much too simple to be able to handle the legacy
schemas that OpenEdge developers have to deal with, which certainly do not fit
the 1:1 mapping (class:table) that ActiveRecord requires.
DataMapper, on the other hand,
[has good support for](http://datamapper.org/docs/legacy) legacy schemas.

## Roadmap (Illustrated)

Now that all of the tough decisions have been made, it's time to review our
migration game plan!  I've drawn a few diagrams that should help illustrate
some of these concepts.

### Step 0

This is what I assume most OpenEdge developers will be starting with.  All
programs are Progress/OpenEdge code.  All data are held in native OpenEdge
databases.
[singlepic id=2 w=500 h=254 float=center]

### Step 1

Begin to migrate some programs over to Ruby.  The database schema should be
able to stay the same - DataMapper mappings will have to be created to map
tables into Ruby objects.  Ruby doesn’t know it is accessing an OpenEdge
database - the OpenEdge SQL-92 engine and JDBC driver make it think it is
connecting to a native SQL database.  However, a DataMapper DataObject wrapper
(`do_openedge`) will have to be written to allow DataMapper to use
the JDBC driver to access the OpenEdge database
([see existing wrappers](http://github.com/datamapper/do)).
[singlepic id=3 w=500 h=247 float=center]

### Step 2

As DataMapper objects begin to mature, and subsystems become fully "Ruby-ized",
it would be prudent to move their data to a native SQL database in order to
speed up the data access.  Holding the data in a native Progress/OpenEdge
database will undoubtedly be a little slower due to the OpenEdge to SQL
conversions that the SQL-92 engine has to make in real-time.  Note that
programs can still talk to eachother, even though they are using different
databases, by using an ESB (e.g. a JMS like ActiveMQ).  Also note that the
migrated Ruby code does not require a JDBC driver anymore; it could be ran on
the native C Ruby interpreter (MRI) for instance, assuming MRI DataObject
wrappers are available for the new database.
[singlepic id=4 w=600 h=600 float=center]

### Step 3

Programs are fully migrated to native Ruby; data is fully migrated to native
SQL database(s).  The database schema and their DataMapper mappings may still
have to be cleaned up from legacy schema format to increase efficiency (e.g. 2
or more tables when only 1 table is needed).
[singlepic id=5 w=500 h=307 float=center]

## Proof of Concept

Here is a proof-of-concept Ruby code snippet that illustrates how an external
language can access OpenEdge data.  This code must be executed from JRuby in
order to make use of the DataDirect JDBC drivers.  You will have to add the
referenced .jar's to your `$CLASSPATH` as well (they came bundled
with my OpenEdge 10.1C installation).  They are, unfortunately, proprietary
software so I cannot attach them to this posting.  Also, you obviously have to
have your OpenEdge database set up for SQL access.

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby">
require 'java'

require 'openedge/base.jar'
require 'openedge/openedge.jar'
require 'openedge/util.jar'

import 'com.ddtek.jdbc.openedge.OpenEdgeDriver'

#Fill in the connection information:
USERNAME = "sqluser"
PASSWORD = "sqlpass"
HOSTNAME = "localhost"
SERVNAME = "sportssv_d"
DBNAME   = "sports"

begin
  conn = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:datadirect:openedge://" + HOSTNAME + ":-1;databaseName=" + DBNAME + ";serviceName=" + SERVNAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
  stmt = conn.createStatement
  rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM \"SPORTS\".\"PUB\".\"customer\"")
  while (rs.next) do
    puts rs.getString("name")
  end
  rs.close
  stmt.close
  conn.close()
end

puts 'Done!'
</code></pre>

## Final Thoughts

In this posting I have attempted to illustrate a relatively thorough migration
path away from Progress OpenEdge ABL.  I hope that I have succeeded, and you
have found this to be useful information (if so, please leave a comment!).  I
would also like to hear from people who have already performed or are planning
to perform a migration away from Progress OpenEdge ABL.

I plan on taking the next step to improve this migration process myself, which
is to write the Ruby DataObject that will implement the DataMapper API for the
DataDirect OpenEdge JDBC drivers.  I will update this posting when that step
has been completed!  It might take me a while, though, as I am new to Ruby.
Wish me luck!
