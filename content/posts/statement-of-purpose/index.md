I’ve held off on getting a blog for a very long time because when they first
became popular several years ago I was kind of turned off by the overblown
importance of them (e.g. CNN linking their stories to the heartbeat of
'the blogosphere').  <!--more-->I have a weird habit of shunning certain
things that become trendy, for no apparent reason.  I guess I like the idea
of doing things in as novel a way as possible or something, in a misguided
desire to feel unique.  It's just the first of my many ideosyncrasies that
you will discover.

Without restricting myself, I hope to use this blog primarily as a personal
archive for my coding exploits and social (primarily family) misadventures.
It will definitely serve as a partial memory cache to augment my own brain,
because as anyone who knows me well knows I am no <a title="Kim Peek"

I generally blame my mother for my horrible memory.  :)  Despite this
limitation, I do occassionally produce mementos I believe to be of value,
so hopefully I can use this blog as a staging area to share these as well
(note: if the memento is code-related, it will generally be hosted on
<a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com/abevoelker" target="_blank">GitHub</a>).

In any case, I will do my best to limit my contribution to the Web crawler
noise out there.  Wasted bandwidth, CPU cycles, human brain cycles (trawling
through junk results), etc. are a detriment to us all.
